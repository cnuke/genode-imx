Memtool port
############

For convenience reasons this target builds a memtool binary from Pengutronix
that can be used within Linux userland to display/modify hardware memory including
memory mapped I/O. It is especially useful to inspect successfully runnning devices
under Linux while porting/debugging device drivers in Genode.

As an example, when memtool is integrated within the initram-filesystem running
on top of a minimal Linux kernel lets say on the Compulab IOT Gate i.MX8 PLUS,
you can display the first 64 32-bit I/O registers of the IOMUX controller
after booting Linux, like so:

! memtool md -l 0x30330000+0x100

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To compile and link memtool appropriatedly, the Genode toolchain is not
sufficient. Instead tools of the host system are used. When building busybox
on a x86_64 host machine for either ARMv8 this target requires a
cross-compilation toolchain to be installed first.

On a x86_64 Debian-based machine, one needs to install for ARM 64-bit:

! apt-get install crossbuild-essential-arm64
