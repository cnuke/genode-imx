This directory contains the implementation of the PWM driver component
for the i.MX 8MQ SoC.

Brief
=====

The driver supports the Pulse Width Modulation controller that can be found in
the i.MX 8MQ SoC. It retrieves its device resources via the platform API.
Moreover, a configuration is needed to set period, sample-rate,
and clock-source.

Configuration
=============

The configuration of the driver looks like the following:

! <config period="5" sample="1000" clock_source="ipg"/>

One can select the clock source in between "ipg", "ipg_highfreq", "ipg_32k".
All other values set the clock source to off. Default values for sample and
period are zero.
